<div class="abstract"> We present a general polynomial method for studying restricted sums of congruence classes modulo a prime. The method provides a unified approach to various problems in additive number theory, including the Cauchy-Davenport theorem and the Erdős-Heilbronn conjecture on sums of distinct residues. </div>
